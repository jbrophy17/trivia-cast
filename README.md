# Trivia-Cast

Trivia-cast is a totally original game conceived just now.

## Game Flow

If no game exists on a given Chromecast, someone will create a new session
using a smartphone app. They will become the leader of that game. The leader's
roles include:

* Advancing the game to a new question

The reader's roles include:

* Reading the answers aloud `8======D`
* Revealing the answers on the Chromecast after they've been read
* Keeping score as answers are guessed

The leader is also the reader in the first round. As soon as a sufficient
number of players have joined, the leader can start the first round by
advancing to a new question. All players will submit their answers via the app,
and once all answers have been submitted, the reader's app will display all
answers.

In keeping with the spirit of the original game, answers will not be shown on
the Chromecast until the reader indicates he or she is done reading the answers
aloud.

The game is played as normal. As answers are correctly guessed, the reader will
select them on the app and choose who guessed the answer. The receiver app will
keep score. Score is displayed on the Chromecast at the end of each round and
is available on the app at all times.
