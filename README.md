## Rules of the Game

* You need at least 3 people (the more the merrier)
* Once everyone has joined the game, via the app, you can start the round from the lobby
* At this point, a prompt will appear on the TV and on everybody's phone
* Everybody writes a response to the given prompt and submits it
* Once everyone has submitted a response, **The Reader** will receive all the responses, in random order, on his/her phone
* **The Reader** should then read each of the responses aloud
* After reading all the responses, **The Reader** becomes **The Guesser**
* **The Guesser** looks at the responses and attempts to guess who said each response, using his/her phone
* If **The Guesser** makes a correct guess, s/he receives 1 point and the guessed player is now **Out**
* If **The Guesser** makes an incorrect guess, his/her turn is over and the next player (who is not **Out**) becomes **The Guesser**
* **The Guesser** continues to guess until s/he makes an incorrect guess or everybody else is **Out**.
* Once everyone except **The Guesser** is **Out**, the round ends
* Any players who joined mid game will be added at the start of the next round
* Play as many rounds as you like
